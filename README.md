# Learning C

This repo has notes and small programs as I learn the C Programming language.

C is a general purpose programming language. It can be run on any operating system or hardware and can be used for a wide range of programming tasks: from systems (e.g. relational databases, operating systems) to application programming.

My objective is to develop familiarity rather than fluency with C. It's been one of the most influential programming languages written, so understanding C means:

- Better understanding the languages it's influenced (e.g. Go)
- Unlocking the ability to interact with critical software written in C (e.g. PG SQL, Linux Kernel)
- Being able to write in C programs that are best expressed in that language
